##How this Program Shall Work

User will plug in Kindle Device to Mac

Mac will detect the Kindle and download the file /documents/My Clippings.txt to /Users/"+username+"/Dropbox/kindle-clippings.txt and replace the file

Mac will read the file and detect any changes

*first search for tags, and search for title - see if the content exists first, to avoid duplicate entries in a book

The changes (new notes) will either be added to previously made Evernote notes and append those notes with added text

	or

Create a new Evernote note for the book and add the new notes
