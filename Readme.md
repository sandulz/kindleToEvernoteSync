##How this Program Shall Work

User will plug in Kindle Device to Mac

Mac will detect the Kindle and download the file /documents/My Clippings.txt to /Users/"+username+"/Dropbox/kindle-clippings.txt and replace the file
if one is previously present

Mac will read the file from the dropbox folder and detect any changes

*first search for tags, and search for title - see if the content exists first, to avoid duplicate entries in a book

File changes (new highlights) will be added to previously made Evernote notes - append those notes

New highlights for new kindle books will create an evernote note within the evernote notebook "Kindle_Highlights"
